All About Roc
=============


Description
-----------

Roc is software for generating and working with ROC ([Receiver Operating
Characteristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic))
and PR
([Precision-Recall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall))
curves.  These curves are typically used to evaluate classification
approaches in areas such as Machine Learning, Statistics, Medicine, and
Epidemiology.  Students, scientists, and researchers are the target
audience of this software.

The goal of this project is to provide software for evaluating ROC and
PR curves that correctly implements the traditional and recent
approaches using languages allowing for flexibility in each
investigator's environment.

Roc, the name of the software, is pronounced "rock" like its namesake,
roc, an enormous, legendary [bird of prey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology)).

Features and Project Maturity
-----------------------------

Roc is version 0.1.0.

This software is still in the alpha stages of design and development.
However, it is mature enough for the authors to use it as part of their
everyday workflow.

It is released as a library and as a command-line interface (CLI)
front-end for the library.  The table below contains a summary of
features.

Features are S=stable, T=tested, I=implemented, P=planned, NP=not
planned, ?=undecided, NA=not applicable.  Languages are J=Java,
P2=Python 2.x.

This software is designed and tested to support 1 million total
examples.  It probably works on many more, but the performance and
accuracy have not been tested at such larger scales.


Requirements
------------

* Java 6 (or later)


Development Requirements
------------------------

If you want to develop this software, there are some additional
requirements.

* Standard Linux core utilities
* GNU Make
* JUnit >= 4.6
* Hamcrest >= 1.3 (if not already included in your JUnit release)

Note that certain JUnit versions contain some Hamcrest classes and so
may conflict with (override) those from Hamcrest.  If you encounter
missing Hamcrest symbols, try placing Hamcrest ahead of JUnit on the
class path or updating JUnit.


Java Library, JAR, CLI
----------------------

The Java library provides an API for working with ROC and PR curves in
your Java programs.  It is distributed as a Java archive (JAR)
containing source code, bytecode, and documentation.  The JAR can be
obtained on the [releases page](http://kboyd.github.io/Roc/releases/).
To include the library in your Java project, just place the JAR in a
convenient location and include it in your classpath.  You can browse
the documentation by extracting it from the JAR or by viewing the
[latest version on GitHub](http://kboyd.github.io/Roc/javadoc/).

The JAR also contains the command-line interface which can be run like
this:

    java -jar roc-0.1.0.jar --help
